      <!-- Section 1: Intro -->
      <section class="analysis-section"
               data-start="0"
               data-end="12"
               data-label="Intro (0:00–0:12)">
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <div class="section-timestamp">0:00 – 0:12</div>
        <p>
          The track opens with a sparse, atmospheric texture — a single sustained
          synth pad drifts in from silence, immediately establishing the harmonic
          center. There's a deliberate sense of space here; the producer leaves
          room for the reverb tail to decay fully before introducing any
          rhythmic elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how the low-end is almost entirely absent at this point. This
          is a classic arrangement technique: by withholding the bass frequencies
          during the intro, the eventual drop hits significantly harder when
          those frequencies finally arrive.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: Verse 1 -->
      <section class="analysis-section"
               data-start="12"
               data-end="28"
               data-label="Verse 1 (0:12–0:28)">
        <h2>Verse 1</h2>
        <div class="section-timestamp">0:12 – 0:28</div>
        <p>
          At 0:12 the beat drops in — a tight, syncopated drum pattern built
          around a pitched 808 kick and crisp hi-hat rolls. The kick pattern
          follows a dotted rhythm that creates a sense of forward momentum
          without feeling rushed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vocal enters here with a half-sung, half-spoken delivery that
          sits right on top of the beat. The processing chain is interesting:
          you can hear subtle pitch correction blended with a short room reverb,
          giving the voice an intimate but polished character. The melody stays
          within a narrow range — mostly stepwise motion — which keeps the
          verse feeling conversational.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harmonically, we're sitting on a i–VI–III–VII progression in a minor
          key. It's a well-worn loop, but the voicings are spread wide enough
          to give it a fresh, open quality.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 3: Chorus -->
      <section class="analysis-section"
               data-start="28"
               data-end="44"
               data-label="Chorus (0:28–0:44)">
        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <div class="section-timestamp">0:28 – 0:44</div>
        <p>
          The chorus lifts everything. The vocal jumps up an octave, the layering
          thickens dramatically — you can hear at least three stacked vocal tracks
          panned across the stereo field. There's a widening effect on the synths
          as well, likely achieved through a combination of chorus and stereo
          delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rhythmically, the drums simplify. The hi-hat drops back to straight
          eighth notes and the kick settles into a four-on-the-floor pattern.
          This is counterintuitive — you'd expect the chorus to get busier — but
          it works because the harmonic and melodic density has increased so
          much that the drums need to anchor rather than compete.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hook itself is essentially a two-bar melodic phrase repeated with
          slight variation. It's catchy precisely because of its simplicity:
          a pentatonic fragment that resolves predictably, making it easy to
          internalize after a single listen.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Bridge -->
      <section class="analysis-section"
               data-start="44"
               data-end="65"
               data-label="Bridge (0:44–1:05)">
        <h2>Bridge</h2>
        <div class="section-timestamp">0:44 – 1:05</div>
        <p>
          The bridge strips things back dramatically. The drums cut out entirely,
          leaving just the vocal and a filtered pad that slowly sweeps upward.
          This creates a moment of tension — the listener instinctively waits
          for the beat to return.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a clever production detail here: a sub-bass tone fades in
          gradually underneath the pad, building physical energy without any
          obvious rhythmic movement. You feel it more than you hear it. By the
          time it reaches full volume around 0:58, there's a palpable sense of
          anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vocal delivery shifts too — more sustained notes, wider intervals,
          pushing into the upper register. The lyrics pivot from narrative to
          something more abstract and emotional, which is a common structural
          choice for bridges: step outside the story to reflect on its meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 1:03, a reverse cymbal and a quick filter sweep signal the
          transition back into the final chorus. It's textbook, but textbook
          for a reason — it works.
        </p>
