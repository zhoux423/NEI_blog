        <p>I've tried the 5 AM club. I've tried cold showers, journaling, meditation apps, gratitude lists, and the "eat the frog" method. Most of them lasted about two weeks. Here's what actually survived contact with real life.</p>

        <h2>1. Water Before Coffee</h2>
        <p>This one sounds too simple to matter, but it's the single change that had the most impact. A full glass of water before any caffeine. It takes ten seconds. The bar is so low that I've never once failed to do it.</p>

        <h2>2. No Phone for the First 20 Minutes</h2>
        <p>I don't use an alarm clock app anymore — I bought a $12 alarm clock. The phone stays in the other room until I've been awake for at least 20 minutes. The difference in how the day feels is hard to overstate.</p>
        <p>Without the phone, you start the day on your own terms. With it, you start the day on everyone else's.</p>

        <h2>3. One Sentence of Writing</h2>
        <p>Not a journal. Not morning pages. Just one sentence about literally anything. Most days it turns into a paragraph. Some days it stays one sentence. Both are fine.</p>

        <blockquote>The trick to building habits isn't discipline. It's making the default action so small that skipping it feels harder than doing it.</blockquote>

        <h2>What Didn't Work</h2>
        <p>Everything with a long setup. If a routine requires more than two steps before I've had coffee, it's dead on arrival. The fancy morning routines you see online work for people who already have their life optimized. For the rest of us, simplicity wins.</p>

        <p>Start with one thing. Do it for a month. Then maybe add another. That's it. That's the whole system.</p>
