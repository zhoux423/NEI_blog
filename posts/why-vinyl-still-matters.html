        <p>There's a moment, right after the needle drops, where the room changes. It's not louder or quieter. It's just... present. That's the thing streaming can't replicate — the physicality of it, the ritual.</p>

        <h2>The Case for Inconvenience</h2>
        <p>Streaming optimized for convenience. Shuffle a playlist, skip in two seconds, never commit to anything. Vinyl forces the opposite. You pick an album. You flip it halfway through. You sit with choices that aren't always comfortable.</p>
        <p>That friction is a feature. In a world where everything is frictionless, choosing to slow down is a radical act.</p>

        <h2>Sound Quality Is Not the Point</h2>
        <p>Audiophiles will argue about warmth and frequency response forever. That's not really why vinyl matters. It matters because it changes your relationship with music from consumption to experience.</p>
        <p>When you hold a record, read the liner notes, and watch it spin — you're participating in something. Spotify is background noise. Vinyl is foreground.</p>

        <h2>Building a Collection</h2>
        <p>There's a joy in crate-digging that algorithm recommendations can't touch. Finding a used copy of an album you love, discovering something you've never heard of because the cover art grabbed you — these are experiences that belong to you, not to a recommendation engine.</p>

        <blockquote>The best albums aren't the ones an algorithm finds for you. They're the ones you stumble into on a Saturday afternoon.</blockquote>

        <p>I'm not saying ditch your streaming subscription. I'm saying consider adding a turntable to the mix. Your ears — and your attention span — will thank you.</p>
