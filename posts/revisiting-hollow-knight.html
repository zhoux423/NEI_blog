        <p>Five years ago, I beat the final boss of Hollow Knight and set the controller down thinking I'd seen everything. I was wrong. Spectacularly, embarrassingly wrong.</p>

        <h2>What I Missed the First Time</h2>
        <p>Turns out, "beating" Hollow Knight and completing Hollow Knight are two very different things. My first playthrough skipped the entire Grimm Troupe questline, most of the dream bosses, and the true ending entirely. I didn't even know the White Palace existed.</p>
        <p>Coming back with fresh eyes — and a much better understanding of the combat system — the game feels almost new.</p>

        <h2>The Combat Clicks Differently Now</h2>
        <p>In 2021, I played Hollow Knight like a button masher who occasionally remembered to heal. This time around, the pogo mechanics, spell timing, and charm builds feel like a language I can actually speak. Fights that took me 30 attempts before are now clean two-try victories.</p>
        <p>The Mantis Lords fight in particular went from a wall to one of the most satisfying encounters in the game. When you can read the patterns, it becomes a dance.</p>

        <h2>The World Holds Up</h2>
        <p>What strikes me most on this replay is how well the world design holds up. There's no quest marker pointing you toward the next objective. The map is something you earn, not something you're given. Every new area feels like a genuine discovery.</p>

        <blockquote>The best exploration in games doesn't tell you where to go. It makes you want to go everywhere.</blockquote>

        <h2>Should You Go Back?</h2>
        <p>If you played Hollow Knight once and moved on — yes. Go back. Start a new save. Take the paths you didn't take last time. There's probably 20 hours of game you haven't seen, and most of it is the best content Team Cherry made.</p>
